# Natural Language Processing with Python

## Summary

An beginner introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics using Python, NLTK, and Jupyter notebook.
Presented via a two-hour Zoom video as part of Parsons Design & Technology peer-to-peer 'dorkshop' series.

## Installations and setup

This workshop uses the following tools:

- `Python3`
- `nltk` library
- `Jupyter Notebook` web application
- `GitHub`

For help with installations and downloads, see [installations.md](https://github.com/annagarbier/dorkshop_nlp/blob/master/installations.md).

## Schedule

1. Intro: _What is NLP? what might we do with it in DT?_
1. `00_setup.ipynb`: _What are some Python string basics, and how do we run them in a Jupyter notebook?_
1. `01_nltk_mini_project.ipynb`: _What is NLTK? What is a tokenizer? What is a part-of-speech tagger? How might we make something fun with these?_
1. `02_nltk_sticker_sheet.ipynb`: _What else can we do with the NLTK library?_

## Learning outcomes

- Basic familiarity with common topics in NLP
- Pointers to tools, methods, and projects related to NLP
- Create a fun, small text-based program using Python in Jupyter Notebook
