# Natural Language Processing with Python

## Summary
A 2-hour, hands-on introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) topics and tools. For beginners who are interested in code and language. Some programming familiarity will be helpful, but experience with Python is not required.

## Before you come to the Dorkshop...
```bash
# Install python3
# Install nltk
# Install Jupyter notebook
```

## Tools we'll use
* Python
* Nltk library
* Jupyter Notebook
